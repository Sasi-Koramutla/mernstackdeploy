# MERN Stack Combined App Deployment on Heroku

## Assumptions
1. You already have an App with Frontend and Backend folders like the below working on your local machine.
       App
        |-- Frontend
        |-- Backend
2.	You have a basic understanding of deploying applications on Heroku


## Deployment Steps
#### Go to your App’s Frontend folder in the command line
#### npm run build 
    -	this will create a build folder in your “Frontend”
    -	copy the contents of the build to your “Backend/public” folder
#### Go to “App.js” (or server.js, whatever file is your entry point) in the root folder of our “Backend”
    -	Add the below code at the top/where you declare the constants
    ```javascript 
    const path = require('path'); 
    ```
    -	Add the below code after your controllers. This code points to the React build folder
     ```javascript
     EXPRESS_APP_NAME.use((req, res, next) => {
        res.sendFile(path.resolve(__dirname, "public", "index.html"));
      });
      ```
#### Keep the environment variables in .env and use “REACT_APP_” before all environment variables. Example below.
    a.	REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL= https://twitterbattle-test.herokuapp.com/
#### Perform the regular Heroku deployment steps
    a.	heroku login
    b.	rm -r node_modules
    c.	heroku create “YOUR_APP”
    d.	git add, commit,  and push
    e.	git push push heroku master
